Build a basic recommendation system using techniques such as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization.

Used the MovieLens dataset to create a recommenders system.
Here is the link to the MovieLens 100K dataset: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/
Used the ml-latest-small dataset which contains 100,000 ratings and 3,600 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 600 users.
